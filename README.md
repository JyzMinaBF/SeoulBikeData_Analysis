# SeoulBikeData_Analysis

This is an thorough analysis of [Seoul Bike Sharing Demand Data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/560/seoul+bike+sharing+demand).

You can also see the information and the work others' made on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhshahane/seoul-bike-sharing-demand-prediction). I will upload my version and constructive analysis in the form for Kaggle users in next version.

Below are the powerpoint slide of [EDA](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tI4HX4j61axCJpGeMhH7RLR3UmI-wrydDgOWgr_sIM4/edit#slide=id.p) and the [evaluation of models](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QpkE6j0khvxowtE9bwe5TbfycAFy07ylwlNFtawdE3c/edit#slide=id.p)

If you wanna see a complete report of the analysis. There is a .docx file which contains all the imformation about it, but there's only Chinese version right now. I might translate it one day.
